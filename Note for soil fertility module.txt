The current soil fertility module only works for GDD mode, for calendar days, it still needs time to figure out the conversion if it needs.

To run the soil fertility module, it needs to run initialization first to calibrate the data (as shown in the *.ipynb test examples). Different from AquaCrop-Win which needs one curve parameter as an input, python requires discrete data points on the curve as inputs.

To compare with AquaCrop-Win, unzip AquaCropV61Nr02052018.zip, and copy the data from AquaCrop_WIN_TEST_DATA to replace the unzipped files. Each time to run the python code, before drawing any figures, need to run the AquaCrop-win with the same setting.

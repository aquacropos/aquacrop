Distinction is made between 3 types of climate files
- files containing temperate data (extension  TMP)
- files containing ETo data (extension ETo)
- files containing rainfall data (extension PLU)

The structure of all files is identical and consists of:
- 5 lines containing information required by the program
- an empty line to separate the information from the records
- 2 lines for the title of the records
- list of records (1 line for each daily, 10-daily or monthly record)
Records are temperature, ETo or rainfall data (only 1 digit allowed)
